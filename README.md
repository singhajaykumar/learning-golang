# Learning Golang (Basic)

Welcome to the **Learning Golang (Basic)** project! ðŸŽ¯

This project is designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of Go (**Golang**). It consists of multiple **mini-projects**, each covering a specific concept in Go.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Table of Contents

1. **First App**
   - Creating a "Hello, World!" program in Go.
   - How to install and run your first Go program.
2. **Learning Variables & Constants**
   - Different ways to declare variables (`var`, `:=`, `const`).
   - Type inference and explicit type declaration.
3. **Learning Data Types in Go**
   - Primitive types (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`).
   - Complex types (`struct`, `array`, `slice`, `map`).
4. **Arrays & Slices**
   - Understanding fixed-size arrays.
   - Working with slices and slice operations.
5. **Loops in Go**
   - `for` loops (with condition, range, and infinite loops).
   - Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`).
6. **If-Else Conditions**
   - Conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
   - Using short variable declarations in conditions.
7. **Switch Statements**
   - Using `switch` for cleaner conditional logic.
   - Type switches for handling different data types.
8. **Working with Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions.
   - Returning multiple values from a function.
   - Understanding function parameters and variadic functions.
9. **Organizing Code with Go Packages**
   - Understanding Go modules and package imports.
   - Structuring projects with multiple packages.
10. **Working with Maps**
    - Declaring and using maps (`map[string]int`).
    - Adding, updating, and deleting key-value pairs.
11. **Working with Structs**
    - Defining and using custom structs.
    - Struct embedding and methods.
12. **Goroutines & Concurrency in Go**
    - Understanding goroutines (`go func()`).
    - Using channels for communication between goroutines.
    - Synchronization with `WaitGroup` and `Mutex`.
